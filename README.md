# energy-prediction-model
- Applied Data Analysis and Visualizations on the available dataset
- Predicted trend of future energy consumption using LSTM 
- Trained model predicted values are almost close to actual values

# Purpose of the Project
- To predict the energy demand for future energy consumption so that companies can make planning for power system generation and operation. With the predicted values at hand, utilities can exercise proper due diligence for future to improve the overall energy efficiency.
